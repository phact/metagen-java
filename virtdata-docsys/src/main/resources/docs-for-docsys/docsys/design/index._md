# Virtdata Docs Design

This directory contains the design docs for the doc system to be used
with Virtdata and downstream projects. This will be called *DocSys* from here forward.

A list of topics is on the left.

The view you are looking at now is rendered by DocSys from a template named
`index._md`. Here is how this view was rendered:

1. The webserver asked for a file named index.html.
2. This file didn't exist, but the DocSys FS layer knew it could be rendered from a source file named index.md, so it looked for one.
3. This file didn't exist, but the DocSys FS layer knew it could be rendered from a source file named index._md, so it looked for one.
4. index.md was rendered as a mustache template from index._md, using a view model which provided all the necessary details from the target URL.
5. index.html was rendered from index.md.

Thus, a chain of rendering occurred: [index._md](index._md) `->` [index.md](index.md) `->` [index.html](index.html). All of these files are viewable.
