# Templating

This doc system comes pre-wired to work with both
markdown and mustache as rendering layers. That means
that you can use either markdown or mustache to edit
or template content.

- [Mustache Docs](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html)
- [JMustache Docs](https://github.com/samskivert/jmustache)
  - [JMustache API](http://samskivert.github.io/jmustache/apidocs/)

However, the mustache templates render markdown by default.
If the need arises to template html directly from mustache,
then this will be added at that time.

## Examples

### paths as markdown
```
{{ paths }}

{{# paths }}
 {{.}}
{{/ paths }}
```

### target as markdown
```
{{ target }}
```

### paths as html
{{ paths }}

### paths as markdown
