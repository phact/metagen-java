# INTRO

The documentation for functions is critical for creators to build data mapping functions from scratch.

## Key Requirements:

Find all named functions available from a library.

Find the documentation that goes along with functions from a library.

See examples of calling those functions.

## Key Challenges:

Javadoc is the more direct way to support documentation of ..


## Documentation Conventions:

If the first javadoc line for an element is a `@see` token, then the documentation
for that referenced element is consulted for it's content, which can be dropped in place.

`@Example` annotations occur on Constructors, not Classes.
